# üìå Interactive Scatter Plot with D3.js

üéØ Description: This is a simple web application that utilizes the D3.js library to create an interactive scatter plot. It allows users to click on any point on the plot to view its x and y coordinates. This project is a great way to get started with data visualization and interactivity using D3.js.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Interactive scatter plot generated using D3.js.
- Click on any point to see its x and y coordinates.
- Adjustable graph dimensions and margins.
- Easy to modify the data points to create custom scatter plots.

## üöÄ Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure and layout for the webpage.
- **CSS**: Basic styling (optional for further customization).
- **JavaScript**: Implements functionality and interactivity using D3.js.
- **D3.js**: JavaScript library used for creating the interactive graph and axes.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/interactive-scatter-plot-d3.git
2. Open the index.html file in your browser to view the scatter plot.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run:
1. Open the index.html file in your browser.

2. The graph will display with several data points.

3. Click on any of the circles in the scatter plot to get the coordinates of that point.

4. The coordinates (x and y) will be displayed in a popup alert.

## Example
The graph visualizes a set of data points, with each point represented by a circle on the plot. You can interact with the plot by clicking on the circles to reveal their x and y positions.

Here's an example of the scatter plot in action:


## Customization
You can easily customize the graph by changing the following parameters:

GRAPH_HEIGHT: Adjusts the height of the graph.

GRAPH_WIDTH: Adjusts the width of the graph.

MARGIN: Adjusts the margin around the graph to control spacing.

DATA: Update the DATA array to add or modify the data points on the plot.
